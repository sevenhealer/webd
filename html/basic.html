        HTML5 has some elements that identify different content areas. 
        These elements make your HTML easier to read and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility.
        The main element is used to represent the main content of the body of an HTML document. 
        Content inside the main element should be unique to the document and should not be repeated in other parts of the document.

                The input element allows you several ways to collect data from a web form. 
                Like img elements, input elements are a void element and do not need closing tags.
                Placeholder text is used to give people a hint about what kind of information to enter into an input.
                To prevent a user from submitting your form when required information is missing, 
                you need to add the required attribute to an input element.

                You can use radio buttons for questions where you want only one answer out of multiple options.

                Each id attribute's value must be unique from all other id values for the entire page.
                If you select the Indoor radio button and submit the form, the form data for the button is based on its name and value attributes
                The fieldset element is used to group related inputs and labels together in a web form.

                The button element is used to create a clickable button.

                However, relying on default behavior may cause confusion.
